# Aggregation Functions

## COUNT()
Returns the number of non-null [field values](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

### Syntax

```
SELECT COUNT( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

#### Nested Syntax
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] )) [...]
```

### Description of Syntax

`COUNT(field_key)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the number of values in a single field.

`COUNT(/regular_expression/)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the number of values for each field with a key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions-in-queries).

`COUNT(*)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the number of values for every field.

`COUNT()` supports all field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.1/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).
InfluxQL supports nesting [`DISTINCT()`](#distinct) with `COUNT()`.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Count the number of non-null field values of a single field key
```
> SELECT COUNT("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   count
----                   -----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   15258
```
The query returns the number of non-null values in the `water_level`
[field key](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#field-key) in the `h2o_feet`
[measurement](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

#### Example 2: Count the number of non-null field values for all field keys in a measurement
```
> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   count_level description   count_water_level
----                   -----------------------   -----------------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   15258                     15258
```
The query returns the number of non-null values for every field key associated
with the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 3: Count the number of non-null field values for field keys that match a regular expression
```
> SELECT COUNT(/water/) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   count_water_level
----                   -----------------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   15258
```
The query returns the number of non-null values for every field key that
contains the word `water` in the `h2o_feet` measurement .

#### Example 4: Count the number of non-null field values for a single field key and include several clauses
```
> SELECT COUNT("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-17T23:48:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m),* fill(200) LIMIT 7 SLIMIT 1

name: h2o_feet
tags: location=coyote_creek
time                   count
----                   -----
2015-08-17T23:48:00Z   200
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2
2015-08-18T00:36:00Z   2
2015-08-18T00:48:00Z   2
```
The query returns the number of non-null values in the `water_level` field key.
It covers the time range between `2015-08-17T23:48:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:54:00Z`
and groups results into 12-minute time intervals and per tag.
The query fills empty time intervals with `200` and limits the number of points
and series returned to seven and one.

#### Example 5: Nest DISTINCT() in COUNT() to count the number of unique values for a single field key
```
> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT("level description")) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   count
----                   -----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   4
```

The query returns the number of unique values in the `level description`
field key and the `h2o_feet` measurement.

### Common Issues with COUNT()

#### Issue 1: COUNT() and fill()
Most InfluxQL functions report `null` values for time interval with no data, and
[`fill(<fill_option>)`](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals-and-fill)
changes the value reported for time intervals that have no data.
`COUNT()` reports `0` for time intervals with no data.
Using `fill(<fill_option>)` with `COUNT()` replaces any `0` values with the given
`fill_option`.

##### Example
<br>
The first query in the codeblock below does not include `fill()`.
The last time interval has no data so the `count` value for that time interval is zero.
The second query includes `fill(800000)`;
it replaces the zero in the last interval with `800000`.

```
> SELECT COUNT("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-09-18T21:24:00Z' AND time <= '2015-09-18T21:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)
name: h2o_feet
time                   count
----                   -----
2015-09-18T21:24:00Z   2
2015-09-18T21:36:00Z   2
2015-09-18T21:48:00Z   0

> SELECT COUNT("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-09-18T21:24:00Z' AND time <= '2015-09-18T21:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m) fill(800000)
name: h2o_feet
time                   count
----                   -----
2015-09-18T21:24:00Z   2
2015-09-18T21:36:00Z   2
2015-09-18T21:48:00Z   800000
```

## DISTINCT()
Returns a list of unique [field values](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

### Syntax
```
SELECT DISTINCT( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] ) FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

#### Nested Syntax
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] )) [...]
```

### Description of Syntax

`DISTINCT(field_key)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the unique values in a single field.

`DISTINCT(/regular_expression/)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the unique values for each field with a key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions-in-queries).

`DISTINCT(*)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the unique values for every field.

`DISTINCT()` supports all field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.1/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).
InfluxQL supports nesting `DISTINCT()` with [`COUNT()`](#count).

### Examples

#### Example 1: List the unique field values for a single field key
```
> SELECT DISTINCT("level description") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   distinct
----                   --------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   between 6 and 9 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   below 3 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   between 3 and 6 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   at or greater than 9 feet
```
The query returns a list in tabular format of each unique value of the `level description` [field](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#field) in the `h2o_feet` [measurement](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

#### Example 2: List the unique field values for all field keys in a measurement
```
> SELECT DISTINCT(*) FROM "h2o_feet" LIMIT 5

name: h2o_feet
time                   distinct_level description   distinct_water_level
----                   --------------------------   --------------------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   below 3 feet                 2.064

1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   between 3 and 6 feet         2.116
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z                                8.005
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z                                2.028
```
The query returns a list of unique values for every field key associated with
the `h2o_feet` measurement.
TODO: unique combinations of field values?

#### Example 3: List the unique field values for field keys that match a regular expression
```
> SELECT DISTINCT(/description/) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   distinct_level description
----                   --------------------------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   below 3 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   between 6 and 9 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   between 3 and 6 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   at or greater than 9 feet
```
The query returns a list of unique values for every field key that contains the
word `description` in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 4: List the unique field values for a single field key and include several clauses
```
>  SELECT DISTINCT("level description") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-17T23:48:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m),* SLIMIT 1

name: h2o_feet
tags: location=coyote_creek
time                   distinct
----                   --------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   between 6 and 9 feet
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   between 6 and 9 feet
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   between 6 and 9 feet
2015-08-18T00:36:00Z   between 6 and 9 feet
2015-08-18T00:48:00Z   between 6 and 9 feet
```
The query returns the unique values in the `level description` field key.
It covers the time range between `2015-08-17T23:48:00Z` and
`2015-08-18T00:54:00Z` and groups results into 12-minute time intervals and
per tag.
The query also limits the number of series returned to one.

#### Example 5: Nest DISTINCT() in COUNT() to count the number of unique values for a single field key
```
> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT("level description")) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   count
----                   -----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   4
```

The query returns the number of unique values in the `level description`
field key and the `h2o_feet` measurement.

### Common Issues with DISTINCT()

#### Issue 1: DISTINCT() and the INTO clause

Using the `DISTINCT()` function with the
[`INTO` clause](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#the-into-clause)
can cause InfluxDB to overwrite points in the destination measurement.
`DISTINCT()` often returns several results with the same timestamp; InfluxDB
assumes [points](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#point) with the same series
and timestamp are duplicate points so it simply overwrites points in the destination
measurement.

##### Example
<br>
Run a `DISTINCT()` query that returns several points with the same timestamp:
```
>  SELECT DISTINCT("level description") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   distinct
----                   --------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   below 3 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   between 6 and 9 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   between 3 and 6 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   at or greater than 9 feet
```
Run the same query with an `INTO` clause:
```
>  SELECT DISTINCT("level description") INTO "distincts" FROM "h2o_feet"

name: result
time                   written
----                   -------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   4
```
Query the data in the destination measurement:
```
> SELECT * FROM "distincts"

name: distincts
time                   distinct
----                   --------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   at or greater than 9 feet
```
Every time InfluxDB writes a point to `distincts` it overwrites the previous point
because each point has the same series and timestamp.
Instead of having four points in `distincts`, we end up with just one point.

## INTEGRAL()
`INTEGRAL()` is not yet functional.

## MEAN()
Returns the arithmetic mean (average) of [field values](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

### Syntax
```
SELECT MEAN( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Syntax

`MEAN(field_key)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the average value for a single field.

`MEAN(/regular_expression/)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the average values for each field with a key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions-in-queries).

`MEAN(*)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the average values for every field.

`MEAN()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.1/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

### Examples

#### Example 1: Calculate the average field values in a single field key
```
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   mean
----                   ----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   4.442107025822522
```
The query returns the average value in the `water_level`
[field key](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#field-key) in the `h2o_feet`
[measurement](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

#### Example 2: Calculate the average field values for all field keys in a measurement
```
> SELECT MEAN(*) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   mean_water_level
----                   ----------------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   4.442107025822522
```
The query returns the average value for every field key that stores numerical
values in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 3: Calculate the average field values for field keys that match a regular expression
```
> SELECT MEAN(/water/) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   mean_water_level
----                   ----------------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   4.442107025822523
```
The query returns the average value for every field key that stores numerical
values and includes the word `water` in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 4: Calculate the average field values for a single field key and include several clauses
```
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-17T23:48:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m),* fill(9.01) LIMIT 7 SLIMIT 1

name: h2o_feet
tags: location=coyote_creek
time                   mean
----                   ----
2015-08-17T23:48:00Z   9.01
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   8.0625
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   7.8245
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   7.5675
2015-08-18T00:36:00Z   7.303
2015-08-18T00:48:00Z   7.11
```
The query returns the average of the values in the `water_level` field key.
It covers the time range between `2015-08-17T23:48:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:54:00Z`
and groups results into 12-minute time intervals and per tag.
The query fills empty time intervals with `9.01` and limits the number of points
and series returned to seven and one.

## MEDIAN()
Returns the middle value from a sorted list of [field values](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#field-value).


### Syntax
```
SELECT MEDIAN( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Syntax

`MEDIAN(field_key)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the middle value for a single field.

`MEDIAN(/regular_expression/)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the middle values for each field with a key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions-in-queries).

`MEDIAN(*)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the middle values for every field.

`MEDIAN()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.1/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

> **Note:** `MEDIAN()` is nearly equivalent to [`PERCENTILE(field_key, 50)`](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/functions/#percentile), except `MEDIAN()` returns the average of the two middle values if the field contains an even number of points.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Calculate the median field values in a single field key
```
> SELECT MEDIAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   median
----                   ------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   4.124
```
The query returns the median value in the `water_level`
[field key](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#field-key) in the `h2o_feet`
[measurement](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

#### Example 2: Calculates the median field values for all field keys in a measurement
```
> SELECT MEDIAN(*) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   median_water_level
----                   ------------------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   4.124
```
The query returns the median value for every field key that stores numerical values
in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 3: Calculate the median field values for field keys that match a regular expression
```
> SELECT MEDIAN(/water/) FROM "h2o_feet"

```
The query returns the smallest three values in the `water_level` field key.
It covers the time range between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:54:00Z`, groups results into 24-minute time intervals and returns results in descending timestamp order.

Notice that the `GROUP BY time()` clause overrides the points' original timestamps.
The timestamps in the results indicate the the start of each 24-minute time interval;
the last three points in the results are for the time interval between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and just before `2015-08-18T00:24:00Z`.

### Common Issues with `BOTTOM()`

#### Issue 1: BOTTOM(), the INTO clause, and the GROUP BY time() clause

Using the `BOTTOM()` function with the
[`INTO` clause](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#the-into-clause)
and the [`GROUP BY time()` clause](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#the-group-by-time-clause)
can cause InfluxDB to overwrite points in the destination measurement.
Using `BOTTOM()` with the `GROUP BY time()` clause often returns several results with the same timestamp; InfluxDB
assumes [points](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#point) with the same series
and timestamp are duplicate points so it simply overwrites points in the destination
measurement.

##### Example
<br>
Run a `BOTTOM()` query that returns several points with the same timestamp:
```
> SELECT BOTTOM("water_level",2),"location" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:24:00Z' GROUP BY time(24m)

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   7.635    coyote_creek
```
Run the same query with an `INTO` clause:
```
> SELECT BOTTOM("water_level",2),"location" INTO "bottom_dweller" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:24:00Z' GROUP BY time(24m)

Query the data in the destination measurement:
```

name: bottom_dweller
time                   bottom   location
----                   ------   --------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2.064    santa_monica
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   7.635    coyote_creek
```
When InfluxDB writes the results to `bottom_dweller` it overwrites any points with the same series and timestamp.
Instead of having four points in `bottom_dweller`, we end up with just two points.

#### Issue 2: BOTTOM() and a tag key with limited tag values

Queries with the syntax `SELECT BOTTOM(<field_key>,<tag_key>,<N>)` can return fewer points than expected.
If the tag key has `X` tag values, the query specifies `N` values, and `X` is smaller than `N`, the query returns `X` points.

##### Example
<br>
```
> SELECT BOTTOM("water_level","location",3) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   bottom   location
----                   ------   --------
2015-08-29T10:36:00Z   -0.243   santa_monica
2015-08-29T14:30:00Z   -0.61    coyote_creek
```

The query specifies the smallest field values of `water_level` for three tag values of the `location` tag key.
Because the `location` tag key has two tag values (`santa_monica` and `coyote_creek`), the query returns two points instead of three.

#### Issue 3: BOTTOM() and tied smallest values

InfluxDB returns the field value with the earliest timestamp if more than one point has the smallest field value.

##### Example
<br>
```
> SELECT BOTTOM("water_level",2) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T04:00:00Z' AND time < '2015-08-18T04:24:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica'

name: h2o_feet
time                   bottom
----                   ------
2015-08-18T04:00:00Z   3.911
2015-08-18T04:06:00Z   4.055
```

In the raw data, `water_level` equals `4.055` at `2015-08-18T04:06:00Z` and at `2015-08-18T04:12:00Z`.
In the case of a tie, InfluxDB returns the point with the earlier timestamp.

### Common Issues with PERCENTILE()

#### Issue 1: PERCENTILE() vs. other InfluxQL functions

* `PERCENTILE(<field_key>,100)` is equivalent to [`MAX(<field_key>)`](#max).
* `PERCENTILE(<field_key>, 50)` is nearly equivalent to [`MEDIAN(<field_key>)`](#median), except the MEDIAN() function returns the average of the two middle values if the field contains an even number of points.
* `PERCENTILE(<field_key>,0)` is not equivalent to [`MIN(<field_key>)`](#min). This is a known [issue](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/4418).

## SAMPLE()
Returns a random sample of `N` values for the specified [field](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#field).
InfluxDB uses [reservoir sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling) to generate the random points.

```

### Description of Syntax

`SAMPLE(field_key,N)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns N random values from the field.

`SAMPLE(/regular_expression/,N)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns N random values for each field with a key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions-in-queries).

`SAMPLE(*,N)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns N random values for every field.

`SAMPLE(field_key,N),tag_key(s)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns N random values from the field and the relevant tag key-values.

`N` must be an integer.
`SAMPLE()` supports all field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.1/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

### Examples

#### Example 1: Select a random sample from a field
```
> SELECT SAMPLE("water_level",2) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   sample
----                   ------
2015-09-09T21:48:00Z   5.659
2015-09-18T10:00:00Z   6.939
```
The query returns two randomly selected points from the `water_level` field
in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

### Example 2: Select a random sample for every field in a measurement
```
> SELECT SAMPLE(*,2) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   sample_level description   sample_water_level
----                   ------------------------   ------------------
2015-08-25T17:06:00Z                              3.284
2015-09-03T04:30:00Z   below 3 feet
2015-09-03T20:06:00Z   between 3 and 6 feet
2015-09-08T21:54:00Z                              3.412
```
The query returns two randomly selected points for every field in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 3: Select a random sample for fields with keys that match a regular expression
```
> SELECT SAMPLE(/level/,2) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   sample_level description   sample_water_level
----                   ------------------------   ------------------
2015-08-30T05:54:00Z   between 6 and 9 feet
2015-09-07T01:18:00Z                              7.854
2015-09-09T20:30:00Z                              7.32
2015-09-13T19:18:00Z   between 3 and 6 feet
```
The query returns two randomly selected points for every field key that includes the word `level` in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 4: Select a random sample from a field and the relevant tag key-values
```
> SELECT SAMPLE("water_level",2),"location" FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   sample   location
----                   ------   --------
2015-08-28T13:06:00Z   2.533    santa_monica
2015-09-07T06:12:00Z   6.145    coyote_creek
```
The query returns two randomly selected points from the `water_level` field and the relevant values of the `location` tag.

#### Example 5: Select a random sample of one point per `GROUP BY time()` interval
```
> SELECT SAMPLE("water_level",1) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(18m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   sample
----                   ------
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2.028
2015-08-18T00:30:00Z   2.051
```

The query returns one randomly selected point per 18-minute `GROUP BY time()`
interval.
Note that the timestamps returned are the points' original timestamps.

### Common Issues with `SAMPLE()`

#### Issue 1: `SAMPLE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause
Queries with `SAMPLE()` and a `GROUP BY time()` clause return the specified
number of points (`N`) per `GROUP BY time()` interval.
For
[most `GROUP BY time()` queries](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals),
the returned timestamps mark the start of the `GROUP BY time()` interval.
`GROUP BY time()` queries with the `SAMPLE()` function behave differently;
they maintain the timestamp of the original data point.

##### Example
<br>
The query below returns two randomly selected points per 18-minute
`GROUP BY time()` interval.
Notice that the returned timestamps are the original timestamps; they
are not forced to match the start of the `GROUP BY time()` intervals.

```
> SELECT SAMPLE("water_level",2) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(18m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   sample
----                   ------
                           __

2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2.028 | <------- Randomly-selected points for the first time interval
                           --
                           __
2015-08-18T00:18:00Z   2.126 |
2015-08-18T00:30:00Z   2.051 | <------- Randomly-selected points for the second time interval
                           --
```

## TOP()

Returns the greatest `N` values in a [field](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#field).

### Syntax
```
SELECT TOP( <field_key>[,<tag_key(s)>],<N> )[,tag_key(s)] [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Syntax

`TOP(field_key,N)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the field's greatest N values.

`TOP(field_key,tag_key(s),N)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the greatest field value for N tag values of the tag key.

`TOP(field_key,N),tag_key(s)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the field's greatest N values and the relevant tag key-value.

The field key must store [int64 or float64](/influxdb/v1.1/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types) values.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Select the greatest three values for a field
```
> SELECT TOP("water_level",3) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   top
----                   ---
2015-08-29T07:18:00Z   9.957
2015-08-29T07:24:00Z   9.964
2015-08-29T07:30:00Z   9.954
```
The query returns the greatest three values associated with the `water_level` field key in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 2: Select the greatest value for a field and two tag key-value pairs
```
> SELECT TOP("water_level","location",2) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   top     location
----                   ---     --------
2015-08-29T03:54:00Z   7.205   santa_monica
2015-08-29T07:24:00Z   9.964   coyote_creek
```
The query returns the greatest values in the `water_level` field key for the two tag key-value pairs associated with the `location` tag key.

#### Example 3: Select the greatest four values for a field and the relevant tag key-values
```
> SELECT TOP("water_level",4),location FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   top     location
----                   ---     --------
2015-08-29T07:18:00Z   9.957   coyote_creek
2015-08-29T07:24:00Z   9.964   coyote_creek
2015-08-29T07:30:00Z   9.954   coyote_creek
2015-08-29T07:36:00Z   9.941   coyote_creek
```
The query returns the greatest four values in the `water_level` field key and the relevant values of the `location` tag.

#### Example 4: Select the greatest three values for a field and include several clauses
```
> SELECT TOP("water_level",3),"location" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(24m) ORDER BY time DESC

2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   7.887   coyote_creek
```
The query returns the greatest three values in the `water_level` field key.
It covers the time range between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:54:00Z`, groups results into 24-minute time intervals and returns results in descending timestamp order.

Notice that the `GROUP BY time()` clause overrides the points' original timestamps.
The timestamps in the results indicate the the start of each 24-minute time interval;
the last three points in the results are for the time interval between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and just before `2015-08-18T00:24:00Z`.

### Common Issues with `TOP()`

#### Issue 1: TOP(), the INTO clause, and the GROUP BY time() clause

Using the `TOP()` function with the
[`INTO` clause](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#the-into-clause)
and the [`GROUP BY time()` clause](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#the-group-by-time-clause)
can cause InfluxDB to overwrite points in the destination measurement.
Using `TOP()` with the `GROUP BY time()` clause often returns several results with the same timestamp; InfluxDB
assumes [points](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#point) with the same series
and timestamp are duplicate points so it simply overwrites points in the destination
measurement.

##### Example
<br>
Run a `TOP()` query that returns several points with the same timestamp:
```
> SELECT TOP("water_level",2),"location" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:24:00Z' GROUP BY time(24m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   top     location
----                   ---     --------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   8.12    coyote_creek
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   8.005   coyote_creek
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   7.635   coyote_creek
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.041   santa_monica
```
Run the same query with an `INTO` clause:
```
> SELECT TOP("water_level",2),"location" INTO "top_dweller" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:24:00Z' GROUP BY time(24m)

name: result
time                   written
----                   -------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   4
```
Query the data in the destination measurement:
```
> SELECT * FROM "top_dweller"

name: top_dweller
time                   location       top
----                   --------       ---
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   coyote_creek   8.005
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   santa_monica   2.041
```
When InfluxDB writes the results to `top_dweller` it overwrites any points with the same series and timestamp.
Instead of having four points in `top_dweller`, we end up with just two points.

#### Issue 2: TOP() and a tag key with limited tag values

Queries with the syntax `SELECT TOP(<field_key>,<tag_key>,<N>)` can return fewer points than expected.
If the tag key has `X` tag values, the query specifies `N` values, and `X` is smaller than `N`, the query returns `X` points.

##### Example
<br>
```
> SELECT TOP("water_level","location",3) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   top     location
----                   ---     --------
2015-08-29T03:54:00Z   7.205   santa_monica
2015-08-29T07:24:00Z   9.964   coyote_creek
```

The query specifies the greates field values of `water_level` for three tag values of the `location` tag key.
Because the `location` tag key has two tag values (`santa_monica` and `coyote_creek`), the query returns two points instead of three.

#### Issue 3: TOP() and tied greatest values

InfluxDB returns the field value with the earliest timestamp if more than one point has the greatest field value.

##### Example
<br>
```
> SELECT TOP("water_level",2) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T04:00:00Z' AND time < '2015-08-18T04:24:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica'

name: h2o_feet
time                   top
----                   ---
2015-08-18T04:06:00Z   4.055
2015-08-18T04:18:00Z   4.124
```

In the raw data, `water_level` equals `4.055` at `2015-08-18T04:06:00Z` and at `2015-08-18T04:12:00Z`.
In the case of a tie, InfluxDB returns the point with the earlier timestamp.

## CUMULATIVE_SUM()
Returns the running total of subsequent values for a
[field](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#field).

### Basic Syntax
```
SELECT CUMULATIVE_SUM( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Basic Syntax

`CUMULATIVE_SUM(field_key)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns cumulative sum of the field's values.

`CUMULATIVE_SUM(/regular_expression/)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the cumulative sum for each field with a key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions-in-queries).

`CUMULATIVE_SUM(*)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the cumulative sum for every field.

`CUMULATIVE_SUM()` supports field keys with int64 and float64 [values](/influxdb/v1.1/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

> **Note:** that the basic syntax does not support [`GROUP BY time()`](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) clauses. See the [Advanced Syntax](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/functions/#advanced-syntax) for how to use `CUMULATIVE_SUM()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

### Examples of Basic Syntax

The examples below work with the following subsample of the `NOAA_water_database`
data:
```
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica'

2015-08-18T00:30:00Z   12.426
```

The query returns the running total for all values associated with the `water_level` field key in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 2: Calculate the cumulative sum for every field in a measurement
```
> SELECT CUMULATIVE_SUM(*) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica'

```

The query returns the running total of all values associated with each numerical field in the `h2o_feet` measurement.
There's only one numerical field in the `h2o_feet` measurement so the query returns one column of results.

#### Example 3: Calculate the cumulative sum for fields with keys that match a regular expression
```

2015-08-18T00:18:00Z   6.218
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   8.246
```

The query returns the running total of all values associated with the `water_level` field.
It covers the time range between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and returns results in descending timestamp order.
The query also limits the number of points returned to four offsets results by two.

### Advanced Syntax

```

### Description of Advanced Syntax

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `CUMULATIVE_SUM()` function to those results.

Supported nested functions:

### Examples of Advanced Syntax

#### Example 1: Use cumulative sum with a `GROUP BY time()` clause
```
> SELECT CUMULATIVE_SUM(MEAN("water_level")) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   cumulative_sum
----                   --------------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2.09
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   4.167
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   6.213
```

The query returns the running total of average `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z`.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates average `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the raw `MEAN()` function:
```
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   mean
----                   ----
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2.09
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2.077
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.0460000000000003
```

Next, InfluxDB calculates the running total of those averages.
The second point in the final results is the sum of `2.09` and `2.077`
and the third point is the sum of `2.09`, `2.077`, and `2.0460000000000003`.

## DERIVATIVE()
Returns the rate of change between subsequent values in a [field](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#field).

### Basic Syntax
```
SELECT DERIVATIVE( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] [ , <unit> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Basic Syntax
InfluxDB calculates the difference between subsequent field values and converts those results into the rate of change per `unit`.
The `unit` argument is a [duration literal](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/spec/#literals) and it is optional.
If the query does not specify the `unit` the unit defaults to one second (`1s`).

`DERIVATIVE(field_key)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns rate rate of change between the field's values.

`DERIVATIVE(/regular_expression/)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the rate of change for each field with a key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions-in-queries).

`DERIVATIVE(*)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the rate of change for every field.

`DERIVATIVE()` supports field keys with int64 and float64 [values](/influxdb/v1.1/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

> **Note:** that the basic syntax does not support [`GROUP BY time()`](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) clauses. See the [Advanced Syntax](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/functions/#advanced-syntax-1) for how to use `DERIVATIVE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

### Examples of Basic Syntax

The examples below work with the following subsample of the `NOAA_water_database` data:

```

```

The query returns the rate of change per one second between the values associated with the `water_level` field key in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

The first result (`0.00014444444444444457`) is the one second rate of change between the first two subsequent field values in the raw data.
InfluxDB calculates the difference between the field values and normalizes that value to the one second rate of change:

```
(2.116 - 2.064) / (360s / 1s)
--------------    ----------
       |               |
       |          the difference between the field values' timestamps / the default unit

```

#### Example 2: Calculate the derivative for a single field and specify the unit
```
> SELECT DERIVATIVE("water_level",6m) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z'

```

The query returns the rate of change per six minutes between the values associated with the `water_level` field key in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

The first result (`0.052000000000000046`) is the six minute rate of change between the first two subsequent field values in the raw data.
InfluxDB calculates the difference between the field values and normalizes that value to the six minute rate of change:

```
(2.116 - 2.064) / (6m / 6m)
--------------    ----------
       |              |

```

The query returns the rate of change per three minutes between the values associated with each numerical field in the `h2o_feet` measurement.
There's only one numerical field in the `h2o_feet` measurement so the query returns one column of results.

The first result (`0.026000000000000023`) is the three minute rate of change between the first two subsequent field values in the raw data.
InfluxDB calculates the difference between the field values and normalizes that value to the three minute rate of change:

```

The query returns the rate of change per two minutes between all values associated with each numerical field in the `h2o_feet` measurement that includes the word `water` in its field key.
There's only one numerical field that includes the word `water` in its field key so the query returns one column of results.

The first result (`0.01733333333333335`) is the two minute rate of change between the first two subsequent field values in the raw data.
InfluxDB calculates the difference between the field values and normalizes that value to the two minute rate of change:

```

2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   -0.0002722222222222218
```

The query returns the rate of change per one second between all values associated with the `water_level` field.
It covers the time range between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and returns results in descending timestamp order.
The query also limits the number of points returned to one and offsets results by two.

The only result (`-0.0002722222222222218`) is the one second rate of change between the relevant subsequent field values in the raw data.
InfluxDB calculates the difference between the field values and normalizes that value to the one second rate of change:

```
(2.126 - 2.028) / (360s / 1s)
--------------    ----------
       |              |
       |          the difference between the field values' timestamps / the default unit

```

### Advanced Syntax
```
SELECT DERIVATIVE(<function> ([ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ]) [ , <unit> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Advanced Syntax

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `DERIVATIVE()` function to those results.

The `unit` argument is a duration literal and it is optional.
If the query does not specify the `unit` the `unit` defaults to the `GROUP BY time()` interval.
Note that this behavior is different from the [basic syntax's](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/functions/#basic-syntax-1) default behavior.

Supported nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max),
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

### Examples of Advanced Syntax

#### Example 1: Use derivative with a `GROUP BY time()` clause
```
> SELECT DERIVATIVE(MEAN("water_level")) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   -0.030999999999999694
```

The query returns the rate of change per 12 minutes between average `water_level`s that are calculates at 12-minute intervals between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z`.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function without the `DERIVATIVE()` function:

```
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.0460000000000003
```
Next, InfluxDB applies the `DERIVATIVE()` function to those averages.
The first result (`-0.0129999999999999`) is the 12-minute rate of change between the first two averages.
InfluxDB calculates the difference between the field values and normalizes that value to the 12-minute rate of change.

```

-------------    ----------
       |               |
       |          the difference between the field values' timestamps / the default unit

#### Example 2: Use derivative with a `GROUP BY time()` clause and specify the unit
```
> SELECT DERIVATIVE(MEAN("water_level"),6m) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

```

The query returns the rate of change per six minutes between average `water_level`s that are calculates at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function without the `DERIVATIVE()` function:

```
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.0460000000000003
```
Next, InfluxDB applies the `DERIVATIVE()` function to those averages.
The first result (`-0.00649999999999995`) is the six-minute rate of change between the first two averages.
InfluxDB calculates the difference between the field values and normalizes that value to the six-minute rate of change.

## DIFFERENCE()
Returns the result of subtraction between subsequent values in a [field](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#field).

### Basic Syntax
```
SELECT DIFFERENCE( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Basic Syntax
`DIFFERENCE(field_key)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the differences between the field's values.

`DIFFERENCE(/regular_expression/)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the differences for each field with a key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions-in-queries).

`DIFFERENCE(*)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the differences for every field.

`DIFFERENCE()` supports field keys with int64 and float64 [values](/influxdb/v1.1/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

> **Note:** that the basic syntax does not support [`GROUP BY time()`](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) clauses. See the [Advanced Syntax](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/functions/#advanced-syntax-2) for how to use `DIFFERENCE())` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

The query returns the difference between the subsequent values associated with the `water_level` field key in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 2: Calculate the difference for every field in a measurement
```
> SELECT DIFFERENCE(*) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica'

2015-08-18T00:30:00Z   0.010000000000000231
```

The query returns the difference between subsequent values for each numerical field in the `h2o_feet` measurement.
There's only one numerical field in the `h2o_feet` measurement so the query returns one column of results.

#### Example 3: Calculate the difference for fields with keys that match a regular expression

```

The query returns the difference between subsequent values for each numerical field in the `h2o_feet` measurement that includes the word `water` in its field key.
There's only one numerical field in the `h2o_feet` measurement so the query returns one column of results.

#### Example 4: Calculate the difference for a single field and include several clauses
```
> SELECT DIFFERENCE("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2

2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   0.08800000000000008
```

The query returns the difference between subsequent values associated with the `water_level` field.
It covers the time range between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and returns results in descending timestamp order.
They query also limits the number of points returned to two and offsets results by two points.

### Advanced Syntax
```
SELECT DIFFERENCE(<function>( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] )) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

#### Description of Advanced Syntax
The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `DIFFERENCE()` function to those results.

Supported nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max),
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

### Examples of Advanced Syntax

#### Example 1: Use `DIFFERENCE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause
```
> SELECT DIFFERENCE(MAX("water_level")) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet

2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   0.009999999999999787
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   -0.07499999999999973
```
The query returns the difference between maximum `water_level` values that are calculated at 12-minute intervals between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z`.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the maximum `water_level` values at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the raw `MAX()` function with a `GROUP BY time()` clause:
```
> SELECT MAX("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   max
----                   ---
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2.116
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2.126
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.051
```
Next, InfluxDB calculates the differences between those maximum values.
The first point in the final results (`0.009999999999999787`) is the difference between `2.126` and `2.116`, and the second point in the final results (`-0.07499999999999973`) is the difference between `2.051` and `2.126`.

## ELAPSED()
Returns the difference between subsequent timestamps in a
[field](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#field).

### Syntax
```
SELECT ELAPSED( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] [ , <unit> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Syntax
InfluxDB calculates the difference between subsequent timestamps.
The `unit` option is a [duration literal](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/spec/#literals) and determines the unit of the returned difference.
If the query does not specify the `unit` option the query returns the difference between timestamps in nanoseconds.

`ELAPSED(field_key)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the difference between the field's timestamps.

`ELAPSED(/regular_expression/)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the difference between timestamps for each field with a key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions-in-queries).

`ELAPSED(*)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the difference between timestamps for every field.

`ELAPSED()` supports all field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.1/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

### Examples

The examples below work with the following subsample of the NOAA_water_database data:

```
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                   water_level
----                   -----------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2.064
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   2.116
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2.028
```

#### Example 1: Calculate the time elapsed between points
```
> SELECT ELAPSED("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

name: h2o_feet

----                   -------
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   360000000000
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   360000000000
```

The query returns the difference between subsequent timestamps in the `water_level` field key and the `h2o_feet` measurement.
By default, InfluxDB returns query results in nanoseconds.

#### Example 2: Calculate the time elapsed between points and specify the unit
```
> SELECT ELAPSED("water_level",1m) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                   elapsed
----                   -------
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   6
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   6
```

The query returns the difference (in minutes) between subsequent timestamps in the `water_level` field key and the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 3: Calculate the time elapsed between points for every field in a measurement
```
> SELECT ELAPSED(*,1m) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                   elapsed_level description   elapsed_water_level
----                   -------------------------   -------------------
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   6                           6
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   6                           6
```

The query returns the difference (in minutes) between subsequent timestamps for every field in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 4: Calculate the time elapsed between points for fields with keys that match a regular expression
```
> SELECT ELAPSED(/level/,1s) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                   elapsed_level description   elapsed_water_level
----                   -------------------------   -------------------
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   360                         360
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   360                         360
```

The query returns the difference between subsequent timestamps for fields in the `h2o_feet` measurement that include the word `level` in the field key.

#### Example 5: Calculate the time elapsed between points and include several clauses
```
> SELECT ELAPSED("water_level",1ms) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z' ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1

name: h2o_feet
time                   elapsed
----                   -------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   -360000
```

The query returns the difference (in milliseconds) between subsequent timestamps in the `water_level` field and the `h2o_feet` measurement.
It covers the time range between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:12:00Z` and sorts timestamps in descending order.
The query also limit the number of points returned to one and offsets results by one point.

Notice that the result is negative; the `ORDER BY time DESC` clause sorts timestamps in descending order so InfluxDB calculates the difference between timestamps in reverse order.

### Common Issues with ELAPSED()

#### Issue 1: ELAPSED() with units greater than the elapsed time

InfluxDB returns `0` if the `unit` option is greater than the difference
between the timestamps.

##### Example
<br>
The timestamps in the `h2o_feet` measurement occur at six minute intervals.
If the query asks for the number of hours between the timestamps, InfluxDB returns `0`:

```
> SELECT ELAPSED("water_level",1h) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                   elapsed
----                   -------
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   0
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   0
```

#### Issue 2: ELAPSED() with GROUP BY time() clauses

The `ELAPSED()` function supports the `GROUP BY time()` clause but the query results aren't particularly useful.
Currently, an `ELAPSED()` query with a nested function and a `GROUP BY time()` clause simply returns the interval specified in the `GROUP BY time()` clause.

The `GROUP BY time()` clause determines the timestamps in the results; each timestamp marks the start of a time interval.
That behavior also applies to selector functions (like `FIRST()` or `MAX()`) which would, in all other cases, return a specific timestamp from the raw data.
Because the `GROUP BY time()` clause overrides the original timestamps, the `ELAPSED()` calculation will always return the same value as the `GROUP BY time()` interval.

##### Example
<br>
In the example below, we attempt to use the `ELAPSED()` function with a `GROUP BY time()` clause to find the time elapsed between minimum `water_level`s.

```
> SELECT ELAPSED(MIN("water_level"),1m) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:36:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   elapsed
----                   -------
2015-08-18T00:36:00Z   12
2015-08-18T00:48:00Z   12
```

InfluxDB first calculates the minimum `water_level` values at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the raw `MIN()` function with a `GROUP BY time() clause`.
Notice that the timestamps in the codeblock below are 12 minutes apart.
In the raw data, the first result (`2.057`) occurs at `2015-08-18T00:42:00Z` but the `GROUP BY time()` clause overrides that timestamp.

```
> SELECT MIN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:36:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   min
----                   ---
2015-08-18T00:36:00Z   2.057
2015-08-18T00:48:00Z   1.991
```

Next, InfluxDB applies the `ELAPSED()` function to those results.
Because the timestamps are determined by the `GROUP BY time()` interval and not original data, the results will always be 12.

## MOVING_AVERAGE()
Returns the rolling average across a window of subsequent values for a [field](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#field).

### Basic Syntax
```
SELECT MOVING_AVERAGE( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] , <N> ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Basic Syntax
`MOVING_AVERAGE()` calculates the rolling average across the a window of `N` subsequent field values.
The `N` argument is an integer and is required.

`MOVING_AVERAGE(field_key,N)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the rolling average across `N` values in the field.

`MOVING_AVERAGE(/regular_expression/,N)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the rolling average across `N` values for every field with a key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions-in-queries).

`MOVING_AVERAGE(*,N)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the rolling average across `N` values for every field.

`MOVING_AVERAGE()` supports field keys with int64 and float64 [values](/influxdb/v1.1/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

> **Note:** that the basic syntax does not support [`GROUP BY time()`](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) clauses. See the [Advanced Syntax](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/functions/#advanced-syntax-3) for how to use `DERIVATIVE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

### Examples of Basic Syntax
The examples below work with the following subsample of the NOAA_water_database data:

```

2015-08-18T00:30:00Z   2.0460000000000003
```

The query returns the rolling average across a two-value window for the `water_level` field in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 2: Calculate the moving average for every numerical field in a measurement
```
> SELECT MOVING_AVERAGE(*,3) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z'

2015-08-18T00:30:00Z   2.0726666666666667
```

The query returns the rolling average across a three-value window for every numerical field in the `h2o_feet` measurement.
There's only one numerical field in that measurement so the query returns one column of results.

#### Example 3: Calculate the moving average for fields with keys that match a regular expression
```
> SELECT MOVING_AVERAGE(/level/,4) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z'

2015-08-18T00:30:00Z    2.0615
```

The query returns the rolling average across a four-value window for each numerical field in the `h2o_feet` measurement that include the word `level` in its field key.
There's only one numerical field that includes the word `level` in its field key so the query return one column of results.

#### Example 4: Calculate the moving average for a single field and include several clauses
```
> SELECT MOVING_AVERAGE("water_level",2) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 2 OFFSET 3

```

The query returns the rolling average across a two-value window for the `water_level` field in the `h2o_feet` measurement.
It covers the time range between `` and `` and returns results in descending timestamp order.
The query also limits the number of points returned to two and offsets results by three points.

### Advanced Syntax

```
SELECT MOVING_AVERAGE(<function> ([ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ]) , N ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Advanced Syntax
The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `MOVING_AVERAGE()` function to those results.

Supported nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max),
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

### Examples of Advanced Syntax

#### Example 1: Use `MOVING_AVERAGE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause
```
> SELECT MOVING_AVERAGE(MAX("water_level"),2) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.0885
```

The query returns the rolling average across a two-value window of 12-minute `water_level` maximums.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the maximum `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MAX()` function without the `MOVING_AVERAGE()` function:

```
> SELECT MAX("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

```

Next, InfluxDB applies the `MOVING_AVERAGE()` function to those maximum values.
The first final result (`2.121`) is the average of the first two maximum values (`(2.116 + 2.126)/2`).

## NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()

Returns the non-negative rate of change between subsequent values in a [field](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#field).
Non-negative includes positive rates of change or rates of change that equal zero.

### Basic Syntax
```
SELECT NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] [ , <unit> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Basic Syntax
InfluxDB calculates the difference between subsequent field values and converts those results into the rate of change per `unit`.
The `unit` argument is a [duration literal](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/spec/#literals) and it is optional.
If the query does not specify the `unit` the unit defaults to one second (`1s`).
`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` returns only positive rates of change or rates of change that equal zero.

`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE(field_key)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the non-negative rate of change between the field's values.

`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE(/regular_expression/)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the non-negative rate of change for each field with a key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions-in-queries).

`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE(*)`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the non-negative rate of change for every field.

`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` supports field keys with int64 and float64 [values](/influxdb/v1.1/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

> **Note:** that the basic syntax does not support [`GROUP BY time()`](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) clauses. See the [Advanced Syntax](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/functions/#advanced-syntax-4) for how to use `NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

### Examples of Basic Syntax

See the [Examples of Basic Syntax](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/functions/#examples-of-basic-syntax-1) section for the `DERIVATIVE()` function.
`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` behaves the same as the `DERIVATIVE()` function but `NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` returns only positive rates of change or rates of change that equal zero.

### Advanced Syntax
```
SELECT NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE(<function> ([ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ]) [ , <unit> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Advanced Syntax

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` function to those results.

The `unit` argument is a duration literal and it is optional.
If the query does not specify the `unit` the `unit` defaults to the `GROUP BY time()` interval.
Note that this behavior is different from the [basic syntax's](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/functions/#basic-syntax-4) default behavior.

Supported nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max),
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` returns only positive rates of change or rates of change that equal zero.

### Examples of Advanced Syntax

See the [Examples of Advanced Syntax](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/functions/#examples-of-advanced-syntax-1) section for the `DERIVATIVE()` function.
`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` behaves the same as the `DERIVATIVE()` function but `NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` returns only positive rates of change or rates of change that equal zero.

# Predictors

## HOLT_WINTERS()
Returns N number of predicted values for a
[field](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#field) using the
[Holt-Winters](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/7/5) seasonal method.

Use `HOLT_WINTERS()` to:

* Predict when data values will cross a given threshold
* Compare predicted values with actual values to detect anomalies in your data

### Syntax
```
SELECT HOLT_WINTERS[_WITH-FIT](<function>(<field_key>),<N>,<S>) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Syntax

`HOLT_WINTERS(function(field_key),N,S)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns `N` seasonally adjusted predicted values for the field.
The `N` predicted values occur at the same interval as the `GROUP BY time()` interval.
If your `GROUP BY time()` interval is `6m` and `N` is `3` you'll
receive three predicted values that are each six minutes apart.
`S` is the seasonal pattern parameter and delimits the length of a seasonal
pattern according to the `GROUP BY time()` interval.
If your `GROUP BY time()` interval is `2m` and `S` is `3`, then the
seasonal pattern occurs every six minutes, that is, every three data points.
If you do not want to seasonally adjust your predicted values, set `S` to `0`
or `1.`

`HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT(function(field_key),N,S)`
&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the fitted values and `N` seasonally adjusted predicted values for
the field.

`HOLT_WINTERS()` and `HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT()` require a nested InfluxQL function and a
`GROUP BY time()` clause.
That ensures that the function receives data that occur at consistent time
intervals.
`HOLT_WINTERS()` and `HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT()` support field keys with int64 or float64 [values](/influxdb/v1.1/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

### Examples

#### Example 1:

In the following example we'll apply `HOLT_WINTERS()` to the data in the
`NOAA_water_database`, and we'll show the results using
[Chronograf](https://docs.influxdata.com/chronograf/v1.1/) visualizations.

**Raw Data**

Our query focuses on the raw `water_level` data in `santa_monica` between August
22, 2015 at 22:12 and August 28, 2015 at 03:00:
```
SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location"='santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-22 22:12:00' AND time <= '2015-08-28 03:00:00'
```

![Raw Data](/img/influxdb/hw_raw_data.png)

**Step 1: Create a Query to Match the Trends of the Raw Data**

We start by writing a `GROUP BY time()` query to match the general trends of the
raw `water_level` data.
We could do this with almost any InfluxQL function, but here we use
[`FIRST()`](#first).

Focusing on the `GROUP BY time()` arguments in the query below, the first
argument (`379m`) matches the length of time that occurs between each peak and
trough of the `water_level` data.
The second argument (`348m`) is the
[offset interval](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#advanced-group-by-time-syntax).
The offset interval alters InfluxDB's default `GROUP BY time()` boundaries to
match the time range of the raw data.

The green line shows the results of the query:
```
SELECT first("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location"='santa_monica' and time >= '2015-08-22 22:12:00' and time <= '2015-08-28 03:00:00' GROUP BY time(379m,348m)
```

![First step](/img/influxdb/hw_first_step.png)

**Step 2: Determine the Seasonal Pattern**

Now that we have a query that matches the trends of the raw `water_level` data
it's time to determine the seasonal pattern in the data.
We'll use this information when we implement the `HOLT_WINTERS()` function in
the next step.

Focusing on the green line in the chart below, notice the pattern that repeats
about every 25 hours and 15 minutes.
That's four data points per season, so `4` is our seasonal pattern argument.

![Second step](/img/influxdb/hw_second_step.png)

**Step 3: Include the HOLT_WINTERS() function**

Now we add the `HOLT_WINTERS()` function to our query.
Here, we'll use `HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT()` so that the query results show both
the fitted values and the predicted values.

Focusing on the `HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT()` arguments in the query below, the
first argument (`10`) tells the function to predict 10 data points.
Each point will be `379m` apart, the same interval as the first argument in the
`GROUP BY time()` clause.

The second argument (`4`) is the seasonal pattern that we determined in the
previous step.

```
SELECT holt_winters_with_fit(first(water_level),10,4) FROM h2o_feet where location='santa_monica' and time >= '2015-08-22 22:12:00' and time <= '2015-08-28 03:00:00' group by time(379m,348m)
```

![Third step](/img/influxdb/hw_third_step.png)

And that's it!
We've successfully predicted water levels in Santa Monica between August 28,
2015 at 04:32 and August 28, 2015 at 13:23.

### Common Issues with `HOLT_WINTERS()`

#### Issue 1: Receiving fewer than `N` points with `HOLT_WINTERS()`
In some cases, users may receive fewer predicted points than
requested by the `N` parameter.
That behavior occurs when the math becomes unstable and cannot forecast more
points.
It implies that either `HOLT_WINTERS()` is not suited for the dataset or that
the seasonal adjustment parameter is invalid and is confusing the algorithm.





## Include multiple functions in a single query
Separate multiple functions in one query with a `,`.

Calculate the [minimum](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/functions/#min) `water_level` and the [maximum](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/functions/#max) `water_level` with a single query:
```
> SELECT MIN("water_level"), MAX("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time			               min	   max
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z	 -0.61	 9.964
```

## Change the value reported for intervals with no data with `fill()`
By default, queries with an InfluxQL function report `null` values for intervals with no data.
Append `fill()` to the end of your query to alter that value.
For a complete discussion of `fill()`, see [Data Exploration](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals-and-fill).

> **Note:** `fill()` works differently with `COUNT()`.
See [the documentation on `COUNT()`](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/functions/#count-and-controlling-the-values-reported-for-intervals-with-no-data) for a function-specific use of `fill()`.

## Rename the output column's title with `AS`

By default, queries that include a function output a column that has the same name as that function.
If you'd like a different column name change it with an `AS` clause.

Before:
```
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time			               mean
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z	 4.442107025822521
```

After:
```
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") AS "dream_name" FROM "h2o_feet"
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time			               dream_name
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z	 4.442107025822521
```

## Common Issues with Functions

### Time ranges after now
TODO

### Aggregation Functions

#### Issue 1: Understanding the returned timestamp
TODO
Aggregation functions return epoch 0 (`1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`) as the timestamp unless you specify a lower bound on the time range.
Then they return the lower bound as the timestamp.

#### Issue 2: Mixing aggregation functions with non-aggregates
TODO

#### Issue 3 (maybe): Getting slightly different results
TODO
Executing `mean()` on the same set of float64 points may yield slightly
different results.
InfluxDB does not sort points before it applies the function which results in
those small discrepancies.

### Selector Functions
TODO
sorts series lexicographically.
